## Changelog:
- Assorted bug fixes - Thomas[![Thomas](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/ro-bot1?style=social)](https://github.com/ro-bot1)
## Additional Notes:
Thomas is by far doing the most work on the actual app, my focus is on this site and helping with secondary projects, and Mason is super busy with setting up the VR project and helping with other projects. Because of this a majority of the updates this month will exclusivley feature Thomas, not that Mason and I were not working but he we were not doing things pertaining to the app. -Samuel
