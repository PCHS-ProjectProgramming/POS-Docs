## How does the actions deployment work?
Good question, you can view the CI.yml file [here](https://github.com/PCHS-ProjectProgramming/POS-Docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) for how the site is statically generated using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and deployment occurs via the gh-pages branch that is generated.

## Additional Notes:

Sadly the site doesn't work yet and it currently deploys in the wrong way (deploying `main` instead of `gh-pages`) however I won't find this out for a few days. - Mason (8/31/22)
