    You **MUST** be logged into a github account to view our build CI changes and access certain repository features     :p
 

## How does the actions deployment work?
Good question, you can view the CI.yml file [here](https://github.com/PCHS-ProjectProgramming/POS-Docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) for how the site is statically generated using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and deployment occurs via the gh-pages branch that is generated.

## Additional Notes:

Sadly the site doesn't work yet and it currently deploys in the wrong way (deploying `main` instead of `gh-pages`) however I won't find this out for a few days. - Mason (8/31/22)

## Additional Notes:

I think I've finally gotten to a place where the Site theme doesn't look like utter garbage in my eyes! Not a lot worth documenting happened today, mostly test commits, and CI Spam.

## Additional Notes:
Major App UI work on the Android Studio end from Thomas starting today, and his learning to use git versioning seems to be going well, other than some gradle build issues on the host end, the app builds correctly on Android Studio, yet still fails to build via the same CI using gradle on our Github Page (Investigation Needed!). - Mason :p

## Additional Notes:
Tons of work today from everyone, the site has finally come together, with the exception of video and image assets still being absent from the final design, however on the Android side the POS theming has gone well and Thomas has started to bend the UI to our will, with some git issues needing resolved, the `use cred helper` toggle fixed these. - Mason :p

## Additional Additional Notes:
This is a compilation of older notes into a week instead of daily updates. The formatting is kinda weird but I'm sure its fine. This will still be a better organizarion structure in the long run as documentation will not be this dense in the future. - Samuel
