## Additional Notes:
Major App UI work on the Android Studio end from Thomas starting today, and his learning to use git versioning seems to be going well, other than some gradle build issues on the host end, the app builds correctly on Android Studio, yet still fails to build via the same CI using gradle on our Github Page (Investigation Needed!). - Mason :p
