## Additional Notes:
A lot of front end design stuff was decided this week and is currently being implemented. We are starting to get a full vision of what we want to do and how exactly we get there. The back end functionality is going to be the most difficult and I dread it as front end starts to wrap up. I am still learning markdown so please forgive any downtick in documentation quality that comes with that - Samuel
